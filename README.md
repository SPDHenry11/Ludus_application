Henrique Ferreira Ludus_application Exercise C#

The developed code is in [Program.cs](https://github.com/SPDHenry11/Ludus_application/blob/main/app/Program.cs)

# How to run the application

## If you are on Windows...

Launch the "app.exe - Atalho" shortcut located in "Ludus_application-main/app.exe - Atalho".

The original .exe is located in "Ludus_application\win-x64\app.exe".

## If the executable doesn't work...

Copy the code in the [Program.cs](https://github.com/SPDHenry11/Ludus_application/blob/main/app/Program.cs) file

Paste the code on the [Online C# Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/online-compiler/)

Click the "Run" Button on the Online compiler's interface.

# Notes

I am comfortable with the other languages (javascript and python) and chose C# for no reason. For this job position, I would most likely use Python due to the easiness of producing statistical graphs through its libraries.

The project runs with "dotnet" (.NET) and is in the "Ludus_application-main/app/" folder.
